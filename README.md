## **Description**

Windows 11 Ultra Optimizer is a lightweight batch script designed for power users who want to fine-tune their system for maximum speed, reduced latency, and minimal background bloat.
Unlike “one-click” optimizers, this tool gives you **full control**: choose exactly which optimizations to apply through an interactive menu before execution.
